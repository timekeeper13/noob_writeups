## Task 5:

Now it's time for a small CTF!

some credentials given

**Username: django-admin
Password: roottoor1212**

## Enumeration

**nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/django_scan <machine_IP>**

We can see SSH running on port 22
and http-alt running on 8000

scan runs we can visit http://<Machine IP>:8000    
we see a Django page with lots of messages about DISALLOWED HOSTS  
So to access it we need to add the machine ip to the allowed hosts  

### 1: Admin panel flag

with the given credentials we cn ssh into the machine  
and change the line in the settings file   

**ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['0.0.0.0', '10.10.147.62']**  

include our machine ip to accesshttps://tryhackme.com/room/django it in browser  
we can now visit the admin login page   http://<machine IP>:8000/admin  
we have many options to login  

--> we can change the password of current admin

with **python3 manage.py changepassword <admin_name >**
and then with that new password we can login to admin portal  
but this is not the recommended way

-->we can create a super user

Navigate to **/home/django-admin/messagebox/**  
Execute the command to create the superuser  
**python3 manage.py createsuperuser**   
Back on the admin page, you can use those credentials to login.  
here is your first flag  


### 2 : user flag?

you have many options here 

-->   
Once you are logged in as django-admin
run ls -la /home you can see that you have access to another user's home folder  
 **StrangeFox**   
 Let's get his flag!


**ls -la /home  
cd /home/StrangeFox  
ls    
cat user.txt  
THM{xxx}**  

--> OR  
you can find a password hash link on the page

StrangeFox         Password hash: **https://pastebin.com/nmKt4BSf**  

visit the link and get the link   
crack it with crackctation **https://crackstation.net/**  

with the credentials   

you can open a new ssh shell and get the flag   
or change the current user with su command  


### 3 : Hidden Flag

there are many ways of getting flag

-->  

get to the home page and   

**grep -r 'THM'**
there is your flag  

-->  OR  

get to the messagebox and you can find home.html
cat it out and here is your final flag
